  /* Random Events Explained: 
      The event variable randomly selects an event from a list of age appropriate events
      based on the player's stage of life.
      An event has three attributes: message, a, and b.
      Message is the message shown to the user.
      A and B are choices the user can make.
      A and B have their own attributes: display and GPT.
      Display is what is shown to the user.
      GPT is how the event is explained to the API. The GPT attribute of the selected option is
      pushed to the player.yearlyEvents array to let the system know what choices they've made.
      
      Example:
      Bobby is a 2 year old who has a random event.
      The random number for the event is 1, so the associated event is randEvents[youngChild][1].
      The event message is "Cindy at daycare took your cookie. What do you do?"
      a:[display: "Bite Her", GPT:"bit Cindy for stealing his cookie at daycare"]
      b:[display: "Cry Loudly", GPT:"cried because Cindy stole his cookie at daycare causing 
      his teacher to give him two and put Cindy in time out "]
      
      The user sees "Cindy at daycare took your cookie. What do you do?" 
      with the buttons "Bite Her" and "Cry Loudly." The GPT API only gets the value from the GPT 
      attribute of the chosen option.*/
  
    //display event 
    // show modal with text = event.message and buttons for event.a.display and event.b.display with values equal 
    //to event.a.GPT and event.b.GPT 
    
    //once option is chosen
    //let choice = option.value
    //player.yearlyEvents.push(choice)
    
    /*optionally, some events have associated actions. Note: "choice" is not yet defined and should be bassed
    on the user's choice.
      To call the action, call
      if (event.choice.action) {
        event.choice.action();
      }
      }
